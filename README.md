# ICP--typescript-project
The icp typescript project 
after creating the token cannistr id, replace the id in line 47 with it
this is a decentalized remote purhase emarketplace smart contract that allows the buying and selling of products
 when the buyer buys a product, he sends the money into the smart contract and the money is held there safe unil the buyer confirms the state and availablilty of the product
then the fund is released into the account of the seller
buyer also has the ablility to track bought product
this type of project solves the issue of trust of people trying to transact from a long distance
example: Mr john in U.K trying to buy food stuffs from nigeria, what assurance does he have he wont get scammed
 what assurance does the seller has he wont get scammed if he delievrs the product first

Note: this is not yet the final state of this project as there might be some few bug and lapses

had to comment out some functions because of the file limit size on azle, code is quite self explaatory

thank you
